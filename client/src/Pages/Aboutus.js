				<h3>About Us</h3>
				<p>
					Living in a busy city, people never have enough time to do all the things. ToGo can change the way people can
					move things and access the city. It's never easy to pick up or drop off packages while people can get stuck in
					traffic, busy with work, or might just forget about it. <br /> <br />
					ToGo connects people to the nearest delivery executive who can take care of the task-in-hand. All that the
					users have to do is to tell where to go, what to get and when. <br /> <br />
					The idea is to get anything from anywhere in the city which can save a lot of time. It helps to knock tasks
					off the to-do list, meet with the instant needs, and live track the task getting accomplished easily, all from
					the comfort of home.
					<br /> <br />
					Getting the forgotten charger somewhere, sending homemade meals to friends and family, delivering parcels and
					documents, dropping of return packages, picking up packages, buying a birthday or an anniversary gift, getting
					food from the favorite restaurant that is too far, skipping last minute runs to get something and so many
					more.
